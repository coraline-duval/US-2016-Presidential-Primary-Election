# US-2016-Presidential-Primary-Election

This project detail is outlined in the file Project1.pdf.
My answer paper is Project 1 - Coraline Duval.pdf

The goal is to build a regression model to predict the percentage of votes in primary election for each county in the testing data.
First, through a simple model, and then through a full regression model where I chose to use forward selection.
